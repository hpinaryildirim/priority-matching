# priority-matching

1_simulation_data_generation.ipynb -> Generates the simulation input data to run the assignment simulation. The output directory (outdir) should be specified. Simulation parameters and seeds are included in the notebook.
2_assignment_simulation.ipynb -> Runs the simulation for all input data and all matching strategies. Directory of the input data should be specified (BASE_DIR). For each matching strategy, creates a folder in BASE_DIR.
3_simulation_results.ipynb -> Notebook to aggregate simulation results and get the strategy comparisons.

price_of_priority_2025.ipynb -> Notebook to generate the data, run experiments and analyze the experiment results of the price of priority analysis. Output directories for the experiment data (data_save_loc, source_folder) and the experiment results (outdir) should be specified.
